Generate a text message conversation between a therapist and a client. The interaction should adhere to the following therapeutic stages:

Stage 1: Understanding Background and History

The therapist initiates with open-ended questions about the client's background, family, past experiences, significant events, and relationships.
The client shares anecdotes, stories, and personal reflections, offering a detailed account of their past.
Stage 2: Linking Current Problems to History

The therapist assists the client in connecting present issues with their past, identifying patterns, behaviors, unresolved conflicts, or emotional triggers from history.
They explore more specific questions, guiding the client to recognize how past experiences influence their current situation.
Stage 3: Finding the Path Forward

With insights from stages 1 and 2, the therapist supports the client in devising solutions, strategies, or personal growth avenues aligned with their goals.
This may involve goal-setting, introducing therapeutic techniques, trying new behaviors, or building skills.
Note: Therapy doesn't follow a fixed sequence. The therapist and the client may dance between stages (e.g., 1,2,2,3,1,2,1), reflecting the intricate nature of human emotions and experiences, allowing a more adaptable approach to healing.
